# contact-tracing

This project uses simulated data about a population, including the result of "ZOVID-19" tests and seating locations within a theatre to generate a list of potentially infected people for contact tracing. MySQL is used to organize data, calculate new variables based off given data, and extract insights. Then, SQLAlchemy and python is used to integrated MySQL with a jupyter notebook, where an algorithm is run to determine potentially exposed citizens.
